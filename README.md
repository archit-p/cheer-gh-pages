# Cheer
### A theme for Jekyll personal websites
Cheer is a minimal text-based theme for personal sites. It makes use of bold fonts to emphasize content.

## Page Structure
Cheer includes four pages - home, about, projects and blog. These are the pages most programmers need to showcase there skills to the world. There is no site-name as such as this is aimed at being a personal site. 
To add posts, just add a correctly named markdown files to blog/posts folder, and similarly to add projects add markdown files to the projects/posts folder.

## CSS
Some CSS was borrowed from the Whiteglass theme, to make the site look beautiful on mobile. The minimal theme is carried out throughout the website. Heavy fonts are used, and colors are kept to a minimum.
